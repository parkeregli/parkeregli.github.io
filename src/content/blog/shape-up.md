I found myself struggling in my most recent "sprint". I missed a critical piece of scope on a recent project, and it felt like I was running on a treadmill. I also got a stomach bug and had some spare time to read and listen to podcasts. 

Recently I discovered that Andrew Wilkinson, a well known investor who is known for starting the agency "Metalab" as well as many other businesses, started his own podcast. I went to go watch his most recent episode: [https://youtu.be/IGU8BJx2hxU?si=cM-Pzzzig8JsL2B1](https://youtu.be/IGU8BJx2hxU?si=cM-Pzzzig8JsL2B1). 

The person he was interviewing was one of the founders of 37Signals, Jason Fried. Although I have heard of Jason Fried and Basecamp, a product made by 37Signals, I did not know much about them. So I happily hopped down the rabbit hole I found myself in and started doing research on 37signals. Low and behold, I found exactly what I have been looking for. A book on software design, Shape Up.

As I read through the book, I started to see how Shape Up could be the solution to some of my struggles. The core principle of Shape Up is simple yet powerful: fixed time, variable scope. Instead of getting bogged down in endless tweaks and perfecting every detail, software features are designed in "small batch" 2-week or "big batch" 6-week cycles. The key is to start with a set timeframe and build the design around what can realistically be achieved within that constraint.

This approach resonated with me. I've always appreciated the emphasis on time-boxing in Agile and Scrum, but Shape Up takes it to the next level by making the time constraint the central design principle. Since most of the development work I have been working on lately has been by just me, I have really appreciated how quick I have been able to deploy some features. However, the eagerness to ship has been my downfall. I have not been accurately assessing the project's scope or the needs of my applications stakeholders. I have been taking some of the feature requests at face value, and not digging down into figuring out what truly is being asked or what the problem is.

This is where I found the concept of the "pitch" in the book helpful.  Before each work cycle, whoever works on the design creates a pitch. This thorough planning stage ensures everyone is aligned and aware of potential pitfalls before work begins. I believe writing out a more detailed "pitch", would help in thinking about what is "written between the lines" of some of the feature requests from stakeholders and tackle the true problems they are facing. I also believe that having the time constraint be at the forefront of the design alleviates some of the issues I have with the Waterfall design method.
There are five main sections in the pitch:
1. Problem
   - The "Problem" section describes the initial idea, use case, or observation that motivates the team to tackle this particular project.
2. Appetite
   - The "Appetite" section defines the amount of time the team is willing to allocate to the project and how that time constraint influences the solution they will develop.
3. Solution
   - The "Solution" section presents the core elements of the proposed approach in a clear and easily understandable manner, ensuring that everyone involved can quickly grasp the concept without going too deep into the design. This allows teams to be more creative and more in control of the problems they are working on. 
4. Rabbit holes
   - The "Rabbit holes" section highlights specific details about the solution that are worth pointing out to prevent potential issues or misunderstandings during the development process. 
5. No-gos
   - Finally, the "No-gos" section explicitly lists any functionality or use cases that are intentionally excluded from the project's scope, helping the team stay focused on delivering a solution that fits within the defined appetite and keeps the problem manageable.

Another thing that I was particularly excited about was the "bug smash" - dedicating an entire cycle to fixing bugs once a year. As the codebase has grown, maintaining it has become increasingly challenging. A focused effort like this could be a game-changer and help maintain a stable application.

It's funny how life works sometimes. A stomach bug and a couple of chance podcast episodes led me down a rabbit hole of discovery, and I ended up stumbling upon a book that could be a game-changer for how I approach my work. Shape Up's principles of "fixed time, variable scope", thorough pitching, and dedicated bug-smashing cycles really struck a chord with me. I can't wait to try out these ideas in my own projects and see how they might help me navigate the challenges I've been facing. Who knows, maybe this unexpected journey will be the key to "shaping up" my software development process and creating solutions that truly make a difference. I guess that's the beauty of keeping an open mind and being willing to explore new ideas - you never know where they might lead you.
